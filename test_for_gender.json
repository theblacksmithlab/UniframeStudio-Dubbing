  "text": "I was just like you. Just another American struggling to live. All I wanted was to have a family. But that felt more and more impossible, because every day, things get more and more expensive. Why is this happening? I had no idea that question would take me to 44 people around the world. My grandparents, they could own a house and a summer house, have a car, three kids, and save money for the future on one income at the age of 30. And now we're seeing an entire generation priced out of the housing market. We now need two incomes to rent an apartment. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to afford a house. I don't know how I'm going to be able to put food on the table for my family because of the rising costs. It is becoming harder and harder for us to get by. Having spent more time working, we're not able to meet our children's needs, our partners' needs, our own needs. Monetary stress is the number one stressor globally. If we're inside our mom's womb and our mom is feeling immense stress, that's going to impact the baby's immune system, their nervous system. So before we've even entered this world, we're already being impacted by money. It's like a rat race. Wake up really early in the morning, go to work, spend 9 to 14 hours a day. It's all survival. Inflation equals great depression or, like, great anxiety. Fewer and fewer people are having children. It's like we can have a cat in a house plant. We're feeling this constant pressure, rising prices, rising cost of living, that is just slowly chipping away at us. Inflation, it leads to all of these issues which we face in society. Life is better now than 50 years ago in the sense that we have more technology at our Life is worse now in the sense that there is less prosperity. I don't believe inflation is going to stop. Most people in the world actually live with double-digit inflation. Housing costs alone, it's like triple or quadruple the price, you know, from just a few years ago, which is ridiculous. Like, how do people manage? Instead of having breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I might just have breakfast and lunch. And then the second day, I might just decide to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That's a treat. But the next day, it's just breakfast. You have to cut back because you need to, you know, make it to next week. The country has to buy more medication to sustain more people having diabetes because they cannot afford to have a balanced diet. And children, when a child is malnourished, it affects their intellectual, physical, psychological development. And they go to school and you wonder why they cannot learn. I don't see where cost of living is going to decrease. Like, that's never the trajectory. It's always up and up and up and up. Inflation, it just keeps going up. Most persons, they have to resort to two jobs, three jobs. The smiles aren't there like they used to be because they don't see an end to it. They will never expect it to stop. They will never expect it to slow down. As a matter of fact, they only expect it to speed up. It demoralizes society. I am not very hopeful that things will improve. I feel sad to feel so negative about it. And deep down, I'm hoping that I am wrong. There's no hope for it getting better. It is like a fight in a war based on the impact that it is likely to have on our children, on ourselves, on this society, on our whole. We no longer see ourselves as people. We're just working day to day. We'll never be able to say at the end of the day that's not living. It's just surviving. That's what we're going to start seeing in the United States. Jamaica frightened me because I could see the U.S. trending in this direction, especially if things keep getting more expensive. I hoped this was as bad as inflation can get, but I was wrong. Remember when you went out with only five pesos in your wallet and that would get you a taxi and that would get you a soda and that would get you a ticket for the club? And now, of course, that's 10,000 pesos. A couple of years ago, I had my kids in for dinner. I spent 500 pesos. Also, two months later, I had kids for dinner and I spent 1,000 pesos. Now, 1,000 pesos wouldn't buy, I don't know, two cartons of yogurt. In 2000, the country had a huge crisis. People lost everything. It was violent. If you are middle class, you become poor. They can't escape inflation. You have to be able to save. You end up begging for the government to provide you assistance. A lot of people rely on the government to help them. You have full cities that 80-85% works from government. You might think that supporting people, yes, is a good thing. I mean, I'm hungry, give me food and that's okay. In the long term, you depend on someone giving you food. You become the guy, that's a good guy that's giving me the food. If inflation goes like hyperinflation, prices disappear, and people won't get food. I think that's possible next year. Argentina was terrifying because, again, I could see the U.S. trending in this direction. Look at the number of homeless people. Look at the number of government employees. It was awful to imagine living through such chaos. But it turns out, inflation doesn't stop here either. I was born in Venezuela. My salary was $800. The same year, my salary went to $200. It's exactly like when you try to take water in your hands. It's like disappearing in front of your eyes. The government goes into panic mode. You're not allowed to charge more than X for milk and eggs. Hugo Chavez, at that time, he expropriated many companies that produced food. They stopped working. So we weren't able to produce our own food. It's so hard to find food, even if you have the money. When I realized that Venezuela was a dictatorship, I decided to leave. Hyperinflation is the cause of all of the major totalitarian regime development historically. The real story of the Weimar was not Kristallnacht. The real story of the Weimar was hyperinflation. The inflation of the 1920s was a significant factor that led to World War II. In 1920, after World War I, Germany was still the third largest economy in the world. By 1924, their currency had hyperinflated to more than 4 billion percent. Students that were going to university abroad, they were able to buy entire blocks worth of property. People felt like they were being stripped naked. All the antiques were being bought up. Everything that was loose was being sold to other parts of the world. People were so poor that prostitution ran wild, debauchery and gambling. That led to a feeling that something big needed to change. We need to have a fresh start and do something radical. I finally found how inflation ends. In desperation and destruction. But why is this happening? What causes inflation? The only reason why things get more expensive is because money is being printed.",
